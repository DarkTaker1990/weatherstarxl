# WeatherStar XL
This is the readme for the WeatherStar XL emulator. It is currently under development and should be available soon for 
Windows 7 or newer, Mac and Linux. 

This project aims to be a faithful recreation of the WeatherStar XL as it was and is planned to include switching between versions 1, 2 and 3 of the XL to your preference.

Planned also is the ability to loop the emulation for running 24/7 so that one can use it for a live stream, a home private weather TV channel or whatever else you decide 
for it to run 24/7. Users will be able to pick and choose segments, choose the durations of said segments, and create custom "flavors" aside from the already included "official"
flavors that the XL actually used.

Check this space for any additional updates as this project gets closer to a beta release. I've got a long way to go so it might be some time before it happens.
